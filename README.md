# Multi-class-Classification-with-Sckit-Learn
In this repository, I'll try to predict time signature of the spotify songs in our dataset. 
**Time Signature** (also known as meter signature, metre signature, or measure signature) is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are to be contained in each bar and which note value is to be given one beat. 
In this dataset, we have 4 kinds of time signatures : 1,3,4,5. As we will classify our dataset according to these 4 time signatures, we'll have multiclass classification problem. 
We'll do this by Scikit-Learn 
To do that, first, we need to import the necessary libraries & our dataset ,and then fit our dataset for our ML models.
